                <p><div style=color:crimson>What did I do:</div> I joined in <i>Ai Si Change Single-chip Summer Camp</i> in 2015. I coded a single-chip machine and built a robot controlled by the single-chip made by myself, which could move in certain routes, grab materials and avoid crushing.I learnt how to separate the whole command into different coded segments and how to break down a huge problem. While working together with my teammates, I became a better co-worker. Also, debugging the program taught me to be patient and carful.</p>
                <p><div style=color:crimson>What did I achieve:</div> Advanced single-chip coding, team spirit, and leadership.</p>

I studied the structures and principles of speaker, introduction to the micro-chip and ways it can be used in electronically devices, and concepts about electricity and magnetic. I designed and built my own electric circuit, and I coded the micro-chip, which enabled the speaker to make different sounds as I input different value to the program. After completing the research, I visited a micro-chip factory, and studied methods to create a micro-chip.</p>
                <p><div style=color:crimson>What did I achieve:</div> Knowledge about micro-chip and skills to create, design, and build a electronic circuit.</p>

                <p><div style=color:crimson>What did I do:</div> I founded a club in our school called PRISMS History Club at the beginning of the freshman year in September 20, 2019. The following list shows the achievement I got for the club.</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>I held the first movie night in November 8, 2019, and participants appreciated the movie <i>300 Spartans</i>.</p>
                    <p>I held the first field trip to Philodophia in November 23, 2019, and participants visited the Mutter Museum, a medical museum collecting rare medical specimen including brain slices of Elbert Einstein, skullcap specimens of Gaussian cannibals, and the biggest colon in the world.</p>
                    <p>I organized poster sessions during the Freshman year. I wrote one article per week and posted them on the school bulletin board. On January 29, 2020, the first poster <i>The Red Dancing Shoes</i> was posted. On February 12, 2020, the second poster <i>The Death of the Emperor</i> was posted. On February 19, 2020, the third poster <i>The Black Death</i> was posted. On February 26, 2020, the forth poster <i>Mrs. Fatima Emerged</i> was posted. On March 4, 2020, the fifth poster <i>The Evil Monk</i> was posted.</p>
                    <p>With the help of my club crews, I updated the poster session into Newsletter composing, in which we compose a Newsletter contains 4~6 articles per two weeks. On April 5, 2020, Newsletter I was posted. On April 20, 2020, Newsletter II was posted. On May 12, 2020, Newsletter III was posted. On May 26, 2020, Newsletter IV was posted.</p>
                </ul>
                <p><div style=color:crimson>What did I achieve:</div> My leadership has been trained while organizing different activities. Since history is not a popular subject in a math and science school, I have to carefully plan every events which are both attracting and meaningful. My ability to solve problem improved a lot while planing those activities.</p>

Fortunately, I was chosen as one of the three candidates who were qualified to be the student conductor. However, since the final selection is decided by taking draws, I was not chosen due to the bad luck. Even though I did not conduct the band eventually, I believe they chose me as a final conductor proved that I am talented.</p>
